Description: 
     Implements a computational framework to predict microbial community-based 
     metabolic profiles with 'O2PLS' model. It provides procedures of model 
     training and prediction. Paired microbiome and metabolome data are needed 
     for modeling, and the trained model can be applied to predict metabolites 
     of analogous environments using new microbial feature abundances.
